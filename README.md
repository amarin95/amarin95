# Hi, I'm Alberto Mar√≠n

![Hello there](https://media.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/giphy.gif)

## I'm a full-stack and Flutter developer working right now from home!

I started my professional carrier as dev in 2018 after finishing my studies in Telecomunication Engineering and I've been working after that until now. I worked in very interesting projects, if you want to check them, I try to keep updated my ![Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-mar%C3%ADn-gonz%C3%A1lez-99349098/) where you can check what I'm doing or what I've done.

Since I discovered Flutter I fell in love with it and I'm always trying to make new apps and improving myself while I work in other projects mostly using Spring and Angular.

Please feel free to contact me or give me any feedback!
